# Data-Mining Final Project
## Exploring the Opioid Crisis

Opioids are drugs that alleviate pain and produce a positive/relaxed sensation in the brain and body. Regardless of the type of opioid, all are addictive. Finding trends in this data can help identify the shortfalls and better protect the community from addictions. This research aims to investigate if there are any similarities in drug classes and deaths, if demographic information and homelessness play a factor in addiction, which states are experiencing a higher addiction rate than others, if prescriptions are increasing over time for these drugs, and if pharmaceutical companies have taken any steps to help combat this epidemic.
